# ÆSIR - Odin Motherboard
Odin Motherboard KiCad Design Files

This repository contains the motherboard KiCad design files for the ÆSIR Odin hybrid rocket.
Its main purpose is to house the on-board computer, a Teensy v3.6, and the breakouts to all external components in the rocket. These include: GPS, Go Pro, telemetry, servo, video/camera transmission, accelerometer, umbilical cord, and a safety pin. Use the reference_breakout.txt file to see where each output goes to. 

aesir.lib contains the schematic symbols for the BMP180, MPU-9250, and the motherboard plate (68 mm diameter)

AESIR.pretty contains the footprints for the BMP180, MPU-9250, and the motherboard plate (68 mm diameter).

The Teensy v3.6 KiCad component is required.
